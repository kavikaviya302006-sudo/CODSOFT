## | **Task No.** | **Project Name**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                           | **Conclusion**                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Task 1**   | To-Do List Application   | A menu-driven Python program that allows users to add, view, update, delete, and clear daily tasks using lists.                                           | This project helped in understanding list operations, loops, and building user-interactive applications.                    |
| **Task 2**   | Advanced Calculator      | A calculator application that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power using functions. | This project strengthened knowledge of functions, exception handling, and modular programming.                              |
| **Task 3**   | Password Generator       | A secure password generator that creates random passwords based on user-defined length and character types using built-in modules.                        | This project improved understanding of Python modules, randomization, and input validation for security-based applications. |
| **Task 4**   | Rock-Paper-Scissors Game | An interactive game where the user plays against the computer with score tracking and replay options.                                                     | This project enhanced logical thinking and implementation of real-time game rules using conditionals and loops.             |
| **Task 5**   | Contact Book Application | A contact management system to store, search, update, and delete contact details using dictionaries.                                                      | This project provided hands-on experience with dictionaries and CRUD operations in Python.                                  |

Task 1: To-Do List Application
A menu-driven application to add, view, update, delete, and clear tasks using Python lists.
Concepts: Lists, loops, conditionals, user input.

Task 2: Advanced Calculator
A calculator that performs basic and advanced arithmetic operations using functions and exception handling.
Concepts: Functions, try-except, loops, arithmetic operators.

Task 3: Password Generator

A customizable password generator allowing users to select length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols).
Concepts: Random module, string module, functions, validation.

Task 4: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

An interactive game where the user plays against the computer with score tracking.
Concepts: Game logic, conditionals, loops, randomization.

Task 5: Contact Book Application

A contact management system to add, view, search, update, and delete contacts using dictionaries.
Concepts: Dictionaries, CRUD operations, functions

🧾 Conclusion

These five Python projects collectively demonstrate my ability to design, implement, and manage real-world applications using Python.
They showcase a solid foundation in core programming concepts and reflect my readiness to take on advanced Python development and real-time projects.

This internship experience significantly enhanced my confidence in Python and prepared me for future software development roles.
