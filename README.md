| **Task 1**   | To-Do List Application   | A menu-driven Python program that allows users to add, view, update, delete, and clear daily tasks using lists.                                           | This project helped in understanding list operations, loops, and building user-interactive applications.                    |
| **Task 2**   | Advanced Calculator      | A calculator application that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power using functions. | This project strengthened knowledge of functions, exception handling, and modular programming.                              |
| **Task 3**   | Password Generator       | A secure password generator that creates random passwords based on user-defined length and character types using built-in modules.                        | This project improved understanding of Python modules, randomization, and input validation for security-based applications. |
| **Task 4**   | Rock-Paper-Scissors Game | An interactive game where the user plays against the computer with score tracking and replay options.                                                     | This project enhanced logical thinking and implementation of real-time game rules using conditionals and loops.             |
| **Task 5**   | Contact Book Application | A contact management system to store, search, update, and delete contact details using dictionaries.                                                      | This project provided hands-on experience with dictionaries and CRUD operations in Python.                                  |
